Virtual addresses span across the virtual memory
while physical addresses are limited by hardware memory.
Virtual addresses are mapped to hardware addresses via
the Memory Management Unit. And as virtual memory might be
bigger than hardware memory, this mapping is usually not 1 to 1.
So while they both represent addresses, virtual and physical addresses
are indeed different.
